Version of Minecraft: `Fabric 1.20.1`

The Homestead modpack is a collection of adventurous, decorational and `Vanilla+` mods, with the main focus on creating a cozy atmosphere. Also, the Homestead modpack includes some mechanical mods that are balanced to fit the rustic atmosphere (no high-tech clutter) such as [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric), [Tom's Simple Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage) and [Wireless Redstone](https://modrinth.com/mod/wirelessredstone).

## üìÖ Translation Plans
The repository includes all files, that will be translated in the future:
